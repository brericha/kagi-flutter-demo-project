      "short_summary": "Archaeologists have unearthed fossil fragments of a partial face in a Spanish cave, dating between 1.1 and 1.4 million years ago, making it the oldest human ancestor face discovered in western Europe. The remains, consisting of the left cheek and upper jaw of an adult from an extinct human species, provide significant new insights into the timeline of human evolution and migration into Europe.",

        "Cave location: The fossil was found in northern Spain at a site that has previously yielded other important early human remains.",
        "Migration patterns: This discovery provides new evidence about early human migration routes from Africa into western Europe.",

      "short_summary": "A total lunar eclipse will occur on March 13-14, 2025, creating a dramatic \"blood moon\" visible across North and South America, with partial visibility in Europe, Africa, and East Asia. During the 65-minute totality phase, the lunar surface will turn a reddish color as Earth blocks direct sunlight from reaching the Moon, with only refracted light from Earth's atmosphere illuminating it.",
      "did_you_know": "During a lunar eclipse, the Moon appears red because Earth's atmosphere filters blue light while allowing red light to pass through and reach the lunar surface, similar to how sunsets appear red.",
      "talking_points": [
        "Timing details: The full eclipse will last over six hours, with the total phase occurring from 2:26 a.m. to 3:31 a.m. EDT (06:26 to 07:31 UTC) on March 14.",
        "Viewing locations: Most of the Americas will experience optimal viewing conditions for the entire eclipse, while parts of Europe and Africa will see it at moonset, and East Asia at moonrise.",
        "Scientific value: Lunar eclipses have historically helped scientists confirm Earth's roundness and continue to provide valuable data about Earth's atmosphere.",
        "Livestream options: Various online platforms will broadcast the eclipse for those unable to view it directly due to location or weather conditions."

The $488 million mission aims to map the entire sky in unprecedented detail, observing over 450 million galaxies and 100 million stars to help scientists understand galaxy formation, cosmic expansion, and search for ingredients of life in interstellar clouds.",

        "Scientific targets: The telescope will study the universe's first moments after the Big Bang and search for water and other life ingredients in icy clouds between stars.",
